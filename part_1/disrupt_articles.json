Activists holding up signs are being conflated with masked vandals throwing Molotov cocktails. On social media, and in Washington, the distinction is fading fast.  President Donald Trump has called attacks on Tesla “domestic terrorism” and threatened to send “terrorist thugs” to prisons in El Salvador. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has pledged to prosecute “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,” even though   the attacks were carried out by “lone offenders.” And Musk’s decision to accuse at least one peaceful protester of “ ” on X has   that equates protest with vandalism, and vandalism with terrorism.  If the government or law enforcement starts treating all anti-Tesla actions as criminal, peaceful protesters could find themselves facing consequences meant for extremists.  “Terrorism is a problematic concept in law enforcement because it is by definition differentiated from other violence by its political nature,” Mike German, a former FBI special agent and fellow at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told TechCrunch. “That’s why we’ve seen counterterrorism measures so often result in problematic outcomes targeting the civil rights of people engaged in First Amendment-protected activity, rather than the people who are committing acts of violence.” The Tesla Takedown protesters have consistently preached nonviolence at rallies and on their  . The movement’s stated goal is not to physically harm Tesla or Musk, but rather to encourage people to sell their Teslas, sell their stock, and stop buying new Teslas.  “The reason that [Musk] is in the position that he is in is because of his wealth, and we feel that if we can continue to drive that Tesla stock price down, we will hit him in the spot that it matters,” Natasha Purdum, a New Jersey-based organizer, told TechCrunch. “Ultimately, we see that as a key to taking down some of the major destruction that is happening in our federal government, courtesy of DOGE and Elon Musk.” Musk is the world’s richest person in large part due to his Tesla stock. He owns roughly 13% of the company, which today is valued at around $829 billion, making Musk’s share worth around $107.8 billion. That wealth has allowed Musk to spend $44 billion to buy Twitter, the primary platform he uses to communicate to his 219 million followers. Musk has also dipped into his own funds to   that helped Trump clinch the election.  As someone who spent 16 years as an FBI special agent focused on domestic terrorism, German says he wouldn’t be surprised to see local police working hand in glove with terrorism taskforces — like   — to monitor Tesla Takedown protests. Per the  , the FBI doesn’t require a factual basis for a suspicion of terrorism to begin conducting physical surveillance, which includes taking photos of people, cars, and license plates, deploying informants to infiltrate a group, accessing private databases, and more.  “It’s also important to understand that law enforcement in the United States is primarily intended to protect the property of the wealthy,” German said. “Corporations in the United States are politically powerful and have access to elected officials and top law enforcement officials. And when their interests are challenged, particularly by protest, they want to present that as a law enforcement issue, rather than as legitimate public concerns about their corporate activities.” The FBI declined to comment on TechCrunch’s question about whether the agency is taking any special action this weekend.   Musk and the Trump administration have ramped up their rhetoric in the lead up to March 29, when at least 213 Tesla Takedown protests are scheduled around the world, from Colorado and Kentucky to Germany, Minnesota, France, and Texas.  On Thursday, Musk appeared on Fox News’ “Special Report” to say that he and Trump are going to “go after…the ones providing the money, the ones pushing the lies and propaganda.” Trump has suggested that the attacks on Tesla property were coordinated to intimidate Musk, despite internal assessments finding otherwise. Musk has also claimed, without showing proof, that certain Tesla Takedown organizers were  , a nonprofit that funds progressive causes and Democratic candidates.  And Bondi has accused Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) of “calling for further insurrection” after Crockett said that Musk needed to be “taken down” at a virtual Tesla Takedown rally last week. Crockett couched that statement with calls for nonviolence and peaceful demonstrations, but regardless, Bondi said she needs to “ .” German says this rhetoric, too, is an old government trick to try to discredit and suppress protest movements by claiming “a handful of acts of violence are the result of the spread of bad ideas, radical ideas.” Purdum, one of the Tesla organizers, advised protesters to put their wellbeing first. Leave if you feel unsafe, adhere to your local protest regulations, don’t trespass, follow police orders, and have a lawyer’s number in your back pocket just in case, she said.   “Authoritarian regimes have a long history of equating peaceful protest with violence,” Stephanie Frizzell, a Tesla Takedown organizer from Dallas, said. “The Tesla Takedown movement has always been and will remain nonviolent. Their goal is to intimidate us into silence as we stand against Musk’s destructive actions — but defending free speech is fundamental to democracy. We will not be deterred.” Topics © 2025 Yahoo."},

The new features arrive as users have been turning to tools like   for help with planning trips. Google Search’s AI Overviews, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, can now help users get trip ideas for certain regions or countries. Starting this week, users can search for something like “create an itinerary for Costa Rica with a focus on nature.”  From there, you will be able to browse through photos and reviews and see locations on an expandable map. When you’re ready to save an itinerary, you can tap “Export” to share the recommendations through Docs or Gmail. Or, you can save them as a custom list in Google Maps. The new feature is available for English language queries in the U.S. on mobile and desktop. Google is also making Gemini’s Gems feature available to everyone for free. A Gem is a tool that lets you create custom AI experts for any task within Gemini. This means that users can now set up a trip planner that can help them pick a destination to go to and suggest what to pack.  In addition, while Google has allowed users to get alerts on price drops for flights for quite some time now, it’s now going to do the same with hotels. Users will now see a new option to track hotel prices for chosen dates and destinations. You can select filters for your hotel search, such as star ratings or beach access, for a specific area. If prices go down, Google will send you an email.  Hotel price tracking is launching globally this week on mobile and desktop browsers. As for Maps, Google is rolling out the ability for users to turn their screenshots into solid vacation plans. When planning a vacation, people often take screenshots to bookmark places they want to visit, but can sometimes forget about these photos in their camera roll.  Now, users can give Maps access to their photos to allow the app to automatically identify places mentioned in your screenshots so you can review and save the ones you want to a list. The places that you save will show up on the map so you can get an overview of your plans.  This feature is rolling out this week in the U.S. in English on iOS, and will launch on Android soon.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even seems to have  , presumably made with GPT-4o’s native image generator. Users seem to be uploading existing images and pictures into ChatGPT and asking the chatbot to re-create it in new styles. OpenAI’s latest update comes on the heels of Google’s release of a similar AI image feature in its Gemini Flash model, which also sparked a viral moment earlier in March when  .  OpenAI’s and Google’s latest tools make it easier than ever to re-create the styles of copyrighted works — simply by typing a text prompt. But the real concern lies in how these AI tools are trained to imitate styles. Are these companies training on copyrighted works, and if so, does that violate copyright law? That’s the question at the core of several ongoing lawsuits against generative AI model developers.  According to Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer at the law firm Neal & McDevitt, products like GPT-4o’s native image generator operate in a legal gray area today. Style is not explicitly protected by copyright, according to Brown, meaning OpenAI does not appear to be breaking the law simply by generating images that look like Studio Ghibli movies. However, Brown says it’s plausible that OpenAI achieved this likeness by training its model on millions of frames from Ghibli’s films. Even if that was the case, several courts are still deciding whether training AI models on copyrighted works falls under fair use protections. “I think this raises the same question that we’ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,” said Brown in an interview. “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?” The New York Times and several publishers are in  , claiming the company trained its AI models on copyrighted works without proper attribution or payment. There have been similar claims brought in lawsuits against other leading AI companies, including Meta and AI image-generation startup Midjourney. In a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson says that while ChatGPT refuses to replicate “the style of individual living artists,” OpenAI does permit it to replicate “broader studio styles.” Of course, it’s worth noting there are living artists who are credited with pioneering their studio’s unique styles, such as Studio Ghibli’s co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki. Evidently, users have also been able to use GPT-4o’s native image-generation feature to re-create styles from other studios and artists. Someone else made a Marc Andreessen portrait in the style of  , and a married couple re-created their  We tested several popular AI image generators — including ones available in Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok, and Playground.ai — to see their ability to match Studio Ghibli’s style. We found OpenAI’s new image generator created the most accurate replica of the animation studio’s style. For now, OpenAI’s and Google’s new image features present a leap forward in what AI models can generate, which seems to be driving a surge in usage. OpenAI delayed the rollout of its new image tool to free-tier users on Wednesday,  . That may be the most important thing for these companies today, but we’ll have to wait for the courts to weigh in on their legality. Topics © 2025 Yahoo."},

Although Zuckerberg used to be known for wearing plain grey T-shirts, he’s since paid  , so it’s likely that his T-shirt choice was not an accident. Zuckerberg said that he knew his employees would be curious to see it anyway, so he arranged for the company to go watch it together. “The whole arc is like, I’m somehow motivated by trying to find a girlfriend, [but] I was dating Priscilla before I started Facebook.” Perhaps this portrayal of Zuckerberg stems from another notorious website he created while a student: Facemash, an app where students could vote on which of their classmates was the hottest. While the service was popular among some students, it   who felt it was a violation of their privacy; he had scraped his classmates’ student ID photos from private servers to make the site. “It’s an unfortunate part of the internet, how people kind of make up a lot of the founding mythology to what they want,” Zuckerberg said.

Milton was convicted in October 2022 of one count of   and two counts of wire fraud related to claims he made about Nikola’s progress to investors. He was   to four years in prison in December 2023. He has been out on a $100 million bond while he appealed that sentence. The pardon comes just a few weeks after Nikola  . The company has been working with the bankruptcy court in Delaware to try to  , and had hoped to close such a deal by mid-April. “It is no wonder why trust and confidence in the Justice Department has eroded to nothing. I wish judges would stop believing whatever the prosecutors feed them so Americans could trust the justice system again,” Milton said in a statement.  Milton was convicted by a jury. He was represented in that trial by Brad Bondi, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings and the brother of current U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Now a free man, Milton has said he plans to release a documentary that he believes will tell his side of the Nikola story.  Milton founded Nikola in 2014. The company didn’t enter the spotlight until 2020, when it became one of the first electric vehicle companies to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). It quickly became a hotly traded stock, especially after General Motors announced a  . The company’s circumstances quickly changed, though.

Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York charged Milton in  , claiming that he had made “false and misleading statements regarding Nikola’s product and technology development,” on social media and in TV, print, and podcast interviews. They said Milton made these claims in order to “induce retail investors to purchase Nikola stock.”  After he was convicted, a judge ordered Milton to   following an arbitration case  . That money was supposed to factor into Nikola’s bankruptcy case. Nikola planned to use those proceeds to settle a class action lawsuit against the company filed by shareholders.

{"title": "Open source devs are fighting AI crawlers with cleverness and vengeance", "author": null, "date": "2025-03-27T16:27:39-07:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/open-source-devs-are-fighting-ai-crawlers-with-cleverness-and-vengeance/", "content": "AI web-crawling bots are the cockroaches of the internet, many software developers believe. Some devs have started fighting back in ingenuous, often humorous ways. While any website might be targeted by bad crawler behavior —   — open source developers are “disproportionately” impacted,   Niccolò Venerandi, developer of a Linux desktop known as Plasma and owner of the blog LibreNews. By their nature, sites hosting free and open source (FOSS) projects share more of their infrastructure publicly, and they also tend to have fewer resources than commercial products. The issue is that many AI bots don’t honor the Robots Exclusion Protocol robot.txt file, the tool that tells bots what not to crawl, originally created for search engine bots. In a “cry for help”   in January, FOSS developer Xe Iaso described how AmazonBot relentlessly pounded on a Git server website to the point of causing DDoS outages. Git servers host FOSS projects so that anyone who wants can download the code or contribute to it. But this bot ignored Iaso’s robot.txt, hid behind other IP addresses, and pretended to be other users, Iaso said. “It’s futile to block AI crawler bots because they lie, change their user agent, use residential IP addresses as proxies, and more,” Iaso lamented.  “They will scrape your site until it falls over, and then they will scrape it some more. They will click every link on every link on every link, viewing the same pages over and over and over and over. Some of them will even click on the same link multiple times in the same second,” the developer wrote in the post. So Iaso fought back with cleverness, building a tool called Anubis.  Anubis is  that must be passed before requests are allowed to hit a Git server. It blocks bots but lets through browsers operated by humans. The funny part: Anubis is the name of a god in Egyptian mythology who leads the dead to judgment.  “Anubis weighed your soul (heart) and if it was heavier than a feather, your heart got eaten and you, like, mega died,” Iaso told TechCrunch. If a web request passes the challenge and is determined to be human,  announces success. The drawing is “my take on anthropomorphizing Anubis,” says Iaso. If it’s a bot, the request gets denied. The wryly named project has spread like the wind among the FOSS community. Iaso   on March 19, and in just a few days, it collected 2,000 stars, 20 contributors, and 39 forks.  The instant popularity of Anubis shows that Iaso’s pain is not unique. In fact, Venerandi shared story after story: Venerandi tells TechCrunch that he knows of multiple other projects experiencing the same issues. One of them “had to temporarily ban all Chinese IP addresses at one point.”   Let that sink in for a moment — that developers “even have to turn to banning entire countries” just to fend off AI bots that ignore robot.txt files, says Venerandi. Beyond weighing the soul of a web requester, other devs believe vengeance is the best defense. A few days ago on  , user   suggested loading robot.txt forbidden pages with “a bucket load of articles on the benefits of drinking bleach” or “articles about positive effect of catching measles on performance in bed.”  “Think we need to aim for the bots to get _negative_ utility value from visiting our traps, not just zero value,” xyzal explained. As it happens, in January, an anonymous creator known as “Aaron” released a tool called   that aims to do exactly that. It traps crawlers in an endless maze of fake content, a goal that the dev admitted to   is aggressive if not downright malicious. The tool is named after a carnivorous plant. And Cloudflare, perhaps the biggest commercial player offering several tools to fend off AI crawlers, last week released a similar tool called AI Labyrinth.  It’s intended to “slow down, confuse, and waste the resources of AI Crawlers and other bots that don’t respect ‘no crawl’ directives,” Cloudflare described  . Cloudflare said it feeds misbehaving AI crawlers “irrelevant content rather than extracting your legitimate website data.” SourceHut’s DeVault told TechCrunch that “Nepenthes has a satisfying sense of justice to it, since it feeds nonsense to the crawlers and poisons their wells, but ultimately Anubis is the solution that worked” for his site. But DeVault also issued a public, heartfelt plea for a more direct fix: “Please stop legitimizing LLMs or AI image generators or GitHub Copilot or any of this garbage. I am begging you to stop using them, stop talking about them, stop making new ones, just stop.” Since the likelihood of that is zilch, developers, particularly in FOSS, are fighting back with cleverness and a touch of humor.

While xAI’s products, including its AI chatbot Grok, were tightly integrated into the X platform before this deal, Friday’s acquisition further combines two of Musk’s most high-profile companies. Musk — who also leads Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink — notes in his post that this deal values X at $33 billion (lowered from an enterprise value of $45 billion due to the company’s $12 billion in debt). Musk originally purchased X for $44 billion in October 2022 and took it private. However, the valuation has swung dramatically in recent years. At one point, Fidelity  .

To fuel these efforts, Musk has gone on a historic fundraising campaign, including a  .

One of the major advantages that xAI has over OpenAI and other startups is its access to X.

From intimate roundtables to our flagship Disrupt conference, we’re bringing together the brightest minds in tech, venture capital, and entrepreneurship to continue our legacy of industry-leading gatherings. This milestone year promises unprecedented opportunities for founders, investors, and innovators to connect, share insights, and shape the future of technology. TechCrunch Disrupt, our flagship event, returns for our 20th anniversary as the definitive gathering place for the tech, venture, and startup worlds. This won’t be your average Disrupt, either. Raising the bar even higher this year, founders whose journeys we have tracked since the start — along with top investors and Silicon Valley’s rising stars — will come together for a three-day celebration of the people and products that have changed, and are continuing to change, the world.  Our legendary Disrupt stage — which has launched countless tech giants and unicorns since 2005 — stands ready to mint the next generation of pioneers. Disrupt is more than an event. It is the definitive place to hear and learn from the people who are shaping our technological future. From founders breaking through the noise, to startup enthusiasts joining the ecosystem, to investors seeking the next big thing, Disrupt remains the industry’s most powerful launchpad for success. With 100+ exhibitors and 10,000+ attendees, these three days of pure opportunity continue our tradition of spotlighting future icons like Mark Zuckerberg, Anne Wojcicki, and Whitney Wolfe Herd. Join the community that’s been discovering and nurturing extraordinary success stories for two decades. In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping every industry, TechCrunch Sessions: AI cuts through the hype to deliver deep, actionable insights for founders, investors, and technologists. This intensive one-day event brings together the pioneers who are building and funding the next generation of AI companies, offering an unparalleled look at where the smart money is flowing and how successful AI startups are navigating this transformative moment. From fine-tuning your AI pitch to scaling infrastructure for millions of users, our carefully curated sessions will equip you with the strategic knowledge needed to thrive in today’s AI-first landscape. Beyond the headlines and buzzwords, we’re diving deep into the foundational technologies that make modern AI possible. Leading technologists and infrastructure providers will share their expertise in building robust AI systems, from selecting the right hardware stack to implementing efficient data architectures and deploying AI agents at scale. Through interactive demonstrations, candid fireside chats, and extensive networking opportunities, attendees will gain practical insights into the tools and technologies that are powering the AI revolution. Whether you’re a founder looking to integrate AI into your product, an investor seeking the next big opportunity, or a technologist thinking about launching your own startup, this is your chance to connect with the people and ideas shaping the future of artificial intelligence. Whether you’re taking your first steps as a founder or scaling toward an IPO, TechCrunch is partnering with   to bring you TC All Stage, where ambitious companies at every growth phase come to level up. Building on our 20-year legacy of empowering founders, we’ve expanded our signature founder-focused event to serve the entire company life cycle. At All Stage, early founders crafting their pitch decks sit alongside Series B leaders tackling hypergrowth, creating an unprecedented environment for cross-pollination of ideas and experience. Want to understand better the process of going public? We’ll have you covered on that front, too. Through dozens of specialized breakout sessions, founders and their teams will gain actionable insights on everything from raising seed funding to managing international expansion, recruiting world-class talent, and navigating the path to public markets.  This intensive day of learning, networking, and relationship-building brings together the most promising companies at every stage, fostering connections that will shape the next generation of tech innovation. StrictlyVC events bring Silicon Valley’s most influential players together for candid, unscripted conversations that you won’t hear anywhere else. These intimate gatherings cut through the noise to deliver what matters most: authentic insights from top investors, founders, and operators who are shaping the future of technology and venture capital.  During these signature evening events, you’ll get unfiltered access to the strategies, challenges, and opportunities that are driving the industry forward. No panels, no pitches — just real talk from the people who are in the trenches making the future happen, and spotting the next big trends before they break. It’s the kind of high-signal, high-value networking that can transform your business or career in a single evening.  April 3:  , hosted by Forerunner Ventures May 12: StrictlyVC London June 18: StrictlyVC Menlo Park, hosted by Mayfield October 28: StrictlyVC @ TechCrunch Disrupt December 4: StrictlyVC Palo Alto, hosted by Playground Global Topics © 2025 Yahoo."},
